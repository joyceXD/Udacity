Antwerp (Antwerpen in Dutch) is an international port city on Belgium’s River Scheldt, with history dating to the Middle Ages. This city is chosen mainly because I've studied in Belgium and it is one of my most faviorate cities. It is a good place for those art amateur. The residence of Rembrandt, called The Rembrandthuis, is also here.
